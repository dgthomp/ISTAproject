This paper provides an outline of the data needed, the user interface and the processing
logic to facilitate the development and launch of a Career Mentoring application.
The effectiveness of any application is correlated with the gathering, and manipulation of data that is of high relevance
and can be disseminated in a timely manner. The nature of this application requires data from multiple sources. These includes, career coaches who are dedicated individuals from their respective career fields, proteges or career explorers and companies that are willing to provide relevant industry related guidance.

Coaches, once vetted, will be given a template called a BioCard. The BioCard will serve as means to solicit data needed to build profiles.
Demographic data in addition to personality traits, hobbies , likes and dislikes will be ascertain to ensure compatibility between coaches and perspective proteges. BioCards will be displayed with a short video clip of a day on the job in their respective career field. Data from proteges will
include demographic data hobbies , likes and dislikes. All data gathered will be maintained in databases.

To enhance user interaction with the application, a simple, clutter - free design will be adopted. The objective is to help the user obtain a coach that is compatible with the least amount of clicks as possible. Once the application is launch users will be prompted to login or create a profile. Users will then receive, preferable a sms with a verification code. Once login is successful, a user is brought to the home/main page which comprises of a running banner displaying short video clips of in-demand careers. Users can click on a section of the banner to see information on that career field in a multimedia format. Users will see on one side of the screen, actions required to complete their user profiles, and suggestions of possible coaches on the other. Coaches auto-populates base on the information they enter in their user profiles. Once the user/ protege is matched to the top three coaches with who they appears to be more compatible, a connect button would be available for the user to reach out to all three coaches.

Coaches will in turn have the option to accept or decline the request. If a coach decline a protege, then the next ranked coach, based on compatibility, will become an option for the protege. Coaches and proteges are deemed compatible if the information submitted by the protege have a match of over 70 percent with the information stored for the coaches in the database. Once the connection is made then both coach and protege can communicate through instant messaging available through the application. There will be options for goal setting and a way to track accomplishments.

Over time, the capabilities of the application will be enhance to reflect changes in the different career fields and to improve user friendliness. The goal is to make career related services accessible and relevant. Being a tool to promote social change and career development, the intention is to keep this application free of cost and available to all.
